Using Object Teams with Maven3

 Declaring <<<org.eclipse.objectteams:objectteams-parent-pom>>> as the parent of your project will add basic capabilities
 for using OT/J in your sources.
 
* Include the parent pom

 For simple cases two declarations in your pom will suffice:

 [[1]] declare the maven repository for fetching Object Teams related modules

+-----
	<repositories>
		<repository>
			<id>ObjectTeamsRepository</id>
			<name>Object Teams Repository</name>
			<url>http://download.eclipse.org/objectteams/maven/3/repository</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
+----- 

 [[1]] declare the parent pom

+-----
	<parent>
		<groupId>org.eclipse.objectteams</groupId>
		<artifactId>objectteams-parent-pom</artifactId>
		<version>2.3.0</version>
	</parent>
+-----

* Effect
 
  The above steps suffice to let you
  
  * use OT/J syntax in your <<<.java>>> sources and have it compiled just like plain Java.
  
  * run OT/J programs via surfire, e.g., as JUnit tests.
    A predefined <<<\<surefire.argline\>>>> is used that ensures that all required jars are on the classpath and the
    OT/J agent is activated.

* Override inherited declarations

  The following declarations, although inherited from <<<objectteams-parent-pom>>> should be overridden per project:
  
  * <<<\<scm\>>>>
  
  * <<<\<url\>>>>
  
  * <<<\<distributionManagement\>\<site\>>>>

  []

  <Note that Maven doesn't cope well with declarations depending on properties like \<project.artifactId\>
  when this declaration is inherited from a project's parent.>
